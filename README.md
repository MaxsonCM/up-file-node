## HOW TO INSTALL AND EXECUTE THE PROJECT

**What you will need ?**

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

With Git installed run the code below in the terminal

git clone https://github.com/MaxsonCM/upload-files-to-mongodb.git
```

**After copying the project and installation of Node Js from the terminal `into the project folder` and run the following command:**

```

Make sure you verify that the MongoDB service is active.

If all is right, we can execute the project with the command below.
```bash
npm run dev
```
`NOTE 1: The default server port is 5000 and is found in the app.js file.`

`NOTE 2: It may be necessary to install the nodemon dependency, because it is a dependency used for development.`

```bash
npm install nodemon -g
```
